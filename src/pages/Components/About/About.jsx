              Our Story
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-500 md:text-xl/relaxed xl:text-base/relaxed dark:text-gray-400 p-5">
              The journey of PETHEEDS began with a shared love for animals and a
              deep-rooted desire to make a difference in their lives. As pet
              owners ourselves, we understand the joy, companionship, and
              unconditional love that pets bring into our homes. Yet, we also
              recognize the challenges and concerns that come with ensuring
              their health and well-being. Driven by a passion for animal
              welfare and a commitment to excellence, we embarked on a mission
              to create a company that would revolutionize the way pets are
              cared for. Drawing upon our collective expertise in veterinary
              medicine, nutrition, and product development, we set out to
              formulate a line of nutraceutical products that would offer a
              natural, holistic approach to pet wellness.
